Methodology:
Start with a breadth exploration of different topics. A one-hour overview of the entire software was cool. I didn't understand it all, but exposure to all the stuff is good.
Every day after beginning:
1. Work on one tutorial of a methodology or tool. 
2. Synthesize something of my own with the tool to help myself integrate it into my understanding.
3. Write about the tool in Cornell note study cards for later quizzing.
