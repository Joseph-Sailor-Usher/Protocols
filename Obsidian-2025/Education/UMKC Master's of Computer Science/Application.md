**Further Information**

There are two groups of applicants who may qualify for a waiver of the Liaison/EngineeringCAS application fee:

1) Applicants from Iran who experience difficulty submitting payments due to sanctions. Please note that while we can waive the UMKC application fee temporarily, you will still be required to pay this fee once you arrive in the US.

2) Applicants who are former degree-seeking students at UMKC

If you fall into one of these two categories, please contact sse@umkc.edu to discuss your fee waiver options.
