I have trouble recalling the last week. I can remember stuff when it comes up in conversation, so it must be encoding, but the recall is not strong enough. I would like to be able to recall more. I do not know how to do that. 

What could do it?

My genes can't be changed, but understanding them can allow me to optimize.
"[[You can only control what you can measure]]."
Epigenetics can be turned off or on somehow.

*Your genes are the actual DNA sequence you inherit from your parents, containing the instructions for your traits, while your epigenetics are chemical modifications on top of your DNA that control whether certain genes are "turned on" or "turned off".*
*Essentially, how your genes are expressed, which can be influenced by **environmental factors like diet and lifestyle,** without changing the underlying DNA sequence itself; think of genes as the words in a book and epigenetics as the highlighting or underlining that determines which words are emphasized at a given time.*

I hadn't included lifestyle. Let's see how people conceive of that.
```
the way in which a person or group lives.
"the benefits of a healthy lifestyle"
```
That's exactly what I would have guessed.
I need more detail than that.
I can take stock of my current situation, and make changes to see what makes changes that I want to see. I want to be healthier.

I will give this to a GPT and see what it thinks.

It gave me a larger model.
