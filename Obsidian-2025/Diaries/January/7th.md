## What do I want to do today?
- Do a leet code

- Organize my room
	- Set aside clothes that I actually want to wear, and store the rest
	- Throw away boxes things came in

## 10:00am leet code on the 7th [[leet code on the 7th]]
I feel really good.
Got the leet code done with only two checks to C++ docs in twenty minutes.
Now reading the faster solutions.
The challenge was to find strings that are substrings of others in a list of strings.
I came up with the brute force version and it worked, but it was slow - 16ms.

## 11:00am
Looked at houses and coordinated with Christina Boveri.
Listened to Chvrches and watched videos on magic the gathering.
Kind of feel like doing more sit ups? Surprising.

## 2:00pm 
Hang out with parents.
Install skyrim mods.
